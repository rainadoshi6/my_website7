Born and brought up in Mumbai, India, I completed my schooling from Bombay Scottish School after which I pursued Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology. Located in a small town in Southern India, Manipal is a student township where I had an enriching academic experience and created bonds for a lifetime. 

My internships at Ernst & Young, Ladderup Wealth and Intellect Design Arena have helped me develop a deep understanding of the world of finance, technology and risk management.

After my under-graduation, I worked as a Business Analyst at **Dell Technologies**. Being a part of *Dell Global Analytics* made me realize the power of data driven decision making and the application to a broad range of problems. To further my understanding of the way the corporate world interprets data, I am pursuing the **Masters in Analytics and Management Program at London Business School**.

The last one year with strict lockdowns in India and work from home, gave me some time to introspect and work on hobbies. I learnt how to ski, went cycling around Mumbai and documented memories by learning video editing and journalling. 

I am a passionate trekker and graphic designer (you can check out a few of my designs [here](https://www.behance.net/rainadoshi/projects)). I also enjoy cycling and photography. After I went on my first trek, my love for mountains grew, and since then I have gone on several high-altitude snow treks including one to the Everest Base Camp, in Nepal where we trekked up to 18000 feet. The mountains help me rejuvenate and find peace from the hectic city life. 

*Here are my favourite snaps from the trek:*
