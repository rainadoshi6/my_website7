<p>Born and brought up in Mumbai, India, I completed my schooling from Bombay Scottish School after which I pursued my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology. Located in a small town in Southern India, Manipal is a student township where I had an enriching academic experience and created bonds for a lifetime.</p>
<p>After my under-graduation, I worked as a Business Analyst at <strong>Dell Technologies</strong>. Being a part of <em>Dell Global Analytics</em> made me realize the power of data driven decision making and I decided to pursue the Masters in Analytics and Management programme at London Business School to explore the vast field of analytics and unleash its true potential by integrating it with business.</p>
<p>The last one year with strict lockdowns in India and work from home, gave me some time to introspect and work on hobbies which I never felt I had the time for. I learnt how to ski, went cycling around Mumbai, documented memories by learning video editing and journalling.</p>
<p>I am a passionate trekker and graphic designer (you can check out a few of my designs <a href="https://www.behance.net/rainadoshi/projects">here</a>),and I enjoy cycling and photography. After I went on my first trek, my love for mountains grew, and since then I have gone on several high-altitude snow treks including one to Everest Base Camp, in the rugged terrain of Nepal where we trekked up to 18000 feet. The mountains help me rejuvenate and find peace from the hectic city life.</p>
<p><em>Here are my favourite snaps from the trek:</em>
